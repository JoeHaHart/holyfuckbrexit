# thanks!

many thanks to [@csb324](https://github.com/csb324) for making the project we copied this from.

# how to run this shit

fucking clone it. run "npm install" and then "npm start". that's it. 

# how to add a fucking link

Fork and clone the repository. Go to src/constants/LinkConstants.js. You'll see where the links live. Add your link in the right section!

Try to link directly to the part of the website that is relevant. i.e. if you're telling people to donate, link directly to the donation form on the organization's website.
